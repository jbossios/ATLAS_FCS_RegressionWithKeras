v07: Version using v6 inputs (which now are correctly normalized, no nan)

v08: Version using v7 inputs (which now normalize etrue and also use all energy samples when computing mean and std. dev. values)

v09: Running for electrons with first version of CSV files (using phiCorrected files). Same layers/eta bins as for photons. Same configuration as for photons used in v08

v10: Same as v08/09 but for pions

v11: DO NOT USE

v12: DO NOT USE

v13: Using all particles as inputs using v4 version

v14: Training photons alone, now using optimal parameters (tanh, 0.001 as learning_rate and 40 nodes)

v15: Training pions alone, now using optimal parameters (tanh, 0.001 as learning_rate and 40 nodes)

v16: Training electrons alone, now using optimal parameters (tanh, 0.001 as learning_rate and 40 nodes)

v17: Training with electrons and photons

v18: Training with pions and electrons

v19: Training photons using set of parameters which give better performance for photons in eta_20_25

v20: Training electrons using set of parameters which give better performance for photons in eta_20_25

v21: Training pions using set of parameters which give better performance for photons in eta_20_25

v22: Training electrons and photons using set of parameters which give better performance for photons in eta_20_25

v4: sending missing jobs from v3 and assigning correctly each job to corresponding set of parameters
v5: same as v4 but for electrons
v6: same as v4 but for pions
